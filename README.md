# Dart-Flutter

Dart is a multi-paradigm programming language developed by Google in 2011. It is similar to other object-oriented programming languages ​​such as Swift, C or Java. Dart is an Ecma standard and is an interesting alternative to JavaScript in the development of Internet-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets. Its popularity has grown thanks to Flutter, a toolkit also from Google that makes it easier for developers to decide what the user experience will be like in their applications and to make changes in real time.
